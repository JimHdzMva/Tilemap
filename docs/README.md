diagrams_for_webmap.key is the source Keynote file used to create the diagrams for the web map; this includes the files in this path, the simplified diagrams used by methodology.html, and the diagram used by "What's New."

Keynote is not Visio, and this is an artifact of the original source data being from a Safecast Conference 2015 presentation.  Still, it's functional as a vector graphics editor for this.
